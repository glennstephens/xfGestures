# xfGestures
I get this question quite a lot, how can I do gesture support with Xamarin.Forms, so this is a sample project that shows you it can be done with the use of custom renderers.

This project is just working through the question and implementing some custom renderers. It is a work in progress but demonstrates how this capability maybe added. 

Right now there is iOS and Android support. You will see the Windows Phone solution in there too but that is to be filled in with the custom renderers there.
